Personal Budget Tracker is a MERN-stack web application built by Shubham Tiwari. It lets users log in securely and manage their income and expenses through categorized transactions. Users can add, edit, delete, and filter transactions by date, category, or amount, with pagination for easy browsing. The dashboard displays total income, total expenses, and current balance, along with D3.js charts for visual insights. Users can also set a monthly budget and compare it against real expenses. The app includes a clean UI, secure JWT authentication, and a well-structured backend using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB.
